With replit we have problems with Google Fit. Replit add this text to correct problem : Google Fit Not Detecting Activities?
If your walking/running activities aren't appearing, your phone may not be sharing data with Google Fit.


Show Setup Instructions
Step 1: Enable Google Fit on Your Phone
Download and open the Google Fit app from your app store
Sign in with the same Google account you used for CalAI
Complete the setup and allow all permissions
Step 2: Enable Activity Detection
In Google Fit, go to Profile ‚Üí Settings
Turn on "Track your activities"
Enable "Activity detection" for walking, running, cycling
üì± Step 3: Test Activity Detection
Go for a 15+ minute walk with your phone in your pocket
Check Google Fit app after your walk - you should see the activity
Return to CalAI and click "Sync Now"
Note: Google Fit may take 15-30 minutes to detect activities automatically. Manual activities work immediately in CalAI using the "Add Workout"¬†feature. But me I don't want my user to make any conf to let google fit well work. Do you agree ? Is there are an other way for detecting steps, runnin, swimming .. ?

Totally get it‚Äîyou don‚Äôt want users to fiddle with Google Fit settings. Here‚Äôs the straight truth:

Can you track steps/runs/swims with no user setup?

On the web/PWA: essentially no. Browsers don‚Äôt expose reliable background step or activity APIs. You can‚Äôt read phone pedometer data without the user connecting a health provider (Fit/Strava) or installing a native app.

On native apps: yes (with a single OS permission prompt). Android/iOS both expose pedometer/activity APIs that don‚Äôt require Google Fit/Apple Health for basic steps.

Best path by platform
1) Your current PWA (what‚Äôs possible now)

Keep Google Fit / Strava as optional data sources (1-tap OAuth + clear copy). This is the only way to get passive/background data in a PWA.

Provide Manual workout + ‚ÄúStart walk‚Äù session (foreground-only step estimate) as a fallback. It won‚Äôt track in the background once the tab/app is closed.

2) Fast upgrade: wrap CalAI with Capacitor ‚Üí publish native apps

This gives you real pedometer access with just the system consent dialog (no Fit/Health setup).

Android (no Google Fit required)

Steps: Sensor.TYPE_STEP_COUNTER / TYPE_STEP_DETECTOR

Activity type (walk/run/bike): Google Play ActivityRecognitionClient

Background collection: Foreground service + notification (Play policy)

Optional: Health Connect (one permission screen) to read steps/calories from other apps

iOS (no HealthKit required for steps)

Steps & distance: CoreMotion.CMPedometer (user grants Motion & Fitness permission)

Activity type: CMMotionActivityManager (walk/run/etc.)

For swimming/heart rate: needs HealthKit or a watch integration

Result: users tap ‚ÄúAllow Motion/Activity‚Äù once; you collect steps/runs automatically. No Google Fit app, no extra toggles.

What about swimming?

Phones rarely detect swim reliably. You typically need data from a watch (Apple Watch / Garmin / Fitbit) via HealthKit, Health Connect, Strava, Garmin/Fitbit APIs. That always requires a one-time connect/permission.

Suggested plan

Phase A (now, PWA)

Keep Google Fit + Strava connect.

Make it feel zero-friction:

One screen: ‚ÄúConnect to count steps automatically‚Äù ‚Üí buttons: Google Fit / Strava / Not now.

If user taps ‚ÄúNot now‚Äù, show ‚ÄúStart Walk‚Äù button that counts steps while app is open and a simple Manual workout form.

A Sync now button (and explain that Fit may take 15‚Äì30 min).

Phase B (4‚Äì7 days) ‚Äî Capacitor wrapper

Wrap your web app with Capacitor (Android first).

Add plugins:

@capacitor/device-motion (or a pedometer plugin) for steps, or a small native module using SensorManager.

Activity Recognition (native/Capacitor community plugin) for walk/run.

Persist background collection with a Foreground service (Android).

iOS: use CMPedometer / CMMotionActivityManager.

Keep Google Fit/Strava optional for workouts & swimming.

Copy you can use (no scary setup)

‚ÄúAllow Motion to count your steps automatically.‚Äù
Button: Enable Motion (opens OS prompt)

‚ÄúConnect a fitness app (optional)‚Äù
Google Fit ¬∑ Strava ¬∑ Skip

‚ÄúNo tracker? Tap Start Walk and we‚Äôll count steps while this screen is open.‚Äù

Decision matrix
Capability	PWA only	Native (Capacitor)
Passive steps in background	‚ùå	‚úÖ (1 OS permission)
Classify walk/run/bike	‚ùå	‚úÖ Activity Recognition (Android) / Core Motion (iOS)
Swimming	‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Fit/Strava/manual	‚ö†Ô∏è Needs watch data (HealthKit/Strava/etc.)
User setup needed	OAuth to Fit/Strava	Single OS permission; providers optional
Bottom line

If you truly want zero configuration, ship a native wrapper and use the OS pedometer.

If you stay PWA-only, you must keep a provider connect (Fit/Strava) for background data, and offer session/manual tracking as a friendly fallback.
