Must-do (before launch)

Make “Scan Your Food” the hero
Move the scan card to the top (or add a floating round “Scan” button bottom-center on mobile). The primary action should be first.

Progress logic & colors
You show 3,690 consumed / 1,800 goal with the bar still green.

When over goal, switch the bar to amber/red, show –1,890 remaining (or “Over by 1,890”).

Add weekly toggle (Day / Week).

Paywall clarity (in the gradient card)
Add pricing right on the card:

$39.99/year (~$3.33/mo) – Most popular

$9.99/month
Use “Start 7-day free trial” (say the duration) + small “Cancel anytime.”
If you’ll keep a free tier, say it: “Free: 2 scans/day.”

Meal cards: editability
Each item should have quick actions: Edit portion, Replace, Delete, More details. A mini portion slider is gold.

Confidence UX
Instead of only “90%”, show “± kcal” or a tooltip explaining confidence. It builds trust.

Remove the blue dev banner
(“temporary development preview…”) for production screenshots/demos.

High-impact polish (next sprint)

Macro chips consistency
Keep same order/colors (Protein/Carbs/Fat) and align grams; consider small icons.

Empty & error states
If no meals yet: friendly illustration + “Try snapping your plate.”
Offline: “We’ll upload when you’re back online.”

Accessibility
Check contrast on light greys; ensure all tap targets ≥ 44 px; add visible focus states.

Performance
Lazy-load meal images; skeleton loaders for the analysis list.

Social proof & trust
Add rating stars/“# scans done”, and links: Privacy, Terms, Data export. If some inference is on-device, say it.

Navigation
For mobile apps, add bottom nav: Home · Scan · History · Profile, with a prominent center Scan FAB.

Microcopy you can drop in

Scan card caption: “Point your camera at the meal. AI estimates calories in ~3s.”

Paywall bullets: “Unlimited scans • Barcode + verified DB • Macro & micro insights • Health/Health Connect sync • Privacy-first data control”

Progress over-goal: “Over goal by 420 cal” (turns amber/red).

What to A/B test first

Paywall position: after 2 free scans vs. immediate.

Trial length: 7 vs 14 days.

Annual price: $39.99 vs $49.99.

Copy: “Don’t log—just snap.” vs “Log meals in 3 seconds.”
